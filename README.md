Welcome to my GitHub page! 

I'm currently a Supply Officer in the Navy, pursuing my Master's of Science online in Systems Engineering through the University of Central Florida with the hope of someday transitiong to a more engineering/science related career following my Naval service. I'm an active Amateur (Ham) Radio operator with an Extra Class license, and I enjoy programming in my spare time and I'm always looking to improve.
