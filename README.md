Welcome to my GitHub page! 

I'd like to discuss a little bit of background information on myself and some of the motivation behind why I decided to jump on and share some of the projects I've worked on or are currently working on. I promise, it will be brief.

My first (and technically only) formal programming experience was in Fortran 95 through a computer programming course that I enrolled in while at the University of Florida pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Physics. Every programming or scripting language that I've picked up since then (e.g., C++, Python, and Powershell) has been entirely self taught, mostly through a combination of reverse engineering other code and trial by error. I mention this not as a point of pride, but more as a warning that the formalism, conventions, or other aspects of my code probably aren't anywhere near the level of a devoted full-time programmer. That being said, I thoroughly enjoy programming and generally try to make my code organized, easy to interpret, and with explanatory comments both for myself and for anyone to offer constructive criticism on what I can improve.
